name: build-base
# This workflow is triggered manually (workflow_dispatch) and intentionally does
# NOT publish an action-base:latest tag.
#
# Background: users who pin to a specific action commit SHA are still affected
# by base image changes because GitHub Actions rebuilds the Docker image from
# the Dockerfile at that commit, which pulls whatever action-base:latest
# resolves to at build time. When we updated action-base:latest as part of the
# trixie migration, it broke all pinned users unexpectedly.
#
# Fix: the base image is now tagged with a Unix timestamp (e.g. action-base:1234567890)
# and the Dockerfile is updated to reference that specific tag. This ensures that
# pinning to an action commit SHA truly isolates users from future base image changes.
